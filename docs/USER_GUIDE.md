# Document Catalog User Guide

This guide provides instructions for non-technical users on how to use the Document Catalog application.

## How to Use

### Accessing the Web App

To use the application, you will need the web app link and a password for uploading files.

- **Link**: Your administrator will provide you with the link to the web app.
- **Password**: A password is required to upload documents. Please get this from your administrator.

### Application Components

The application has three main components:

1.  **Search Bar**: For finding documents.
2.  **Filters**: For refining your search results.
3.  **Feed**: Displays the search results.

### Using the Search Bar

You can type a word or a combination of words into the search bar to find documents.

- **Simple Search**: Type a single word to find all documents containing that word.
- **Advanced Search**: You can use operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine words for more specific searches.
  - `word <AND> word`: Returns documents containing both words.
  - `word <OR> word`: Returns documents containing either word.
  - `word <NOT> word`: Returns documents containing the first word but not the second.

### Using Filters

Filters are located on the left column of the screen and help you narrow down your search results.

#### Search for a Keyword

1.  **Type a Keyword**: In the "Filter by Term" search box, type a keyword you are looking for.
2.  **Select a Category**: The filters will show categories that contain your keyword. Click on a category to expand it.
3.  **Select a Keyword**: Click on the desired keyword from the list to apply the filter.

#### Select Other Filters

You can also sort your results using the following filters:

- **Upload Date**:
  - **Newest First**: Orders results from the newest to the oldest upload date.
  - **Oldest First**: Orders results from the oldest to the newest upload date.
- **Filename**: Orders results alphabetically from Z to A by title.
- **Filesize**: Orders results from the largest to the smallest file size.

### Understanding the Feed

The feed is where your search results are displayed.

- **Default View**: When you first open the app, the most recently uploaded documents will be at the top of the feed.
- **After Searching/Filtering**: When you use the search bar or apply filters, the documents with the highest relevance to your search will appear at the top of the feed.

#### Using the Search Bar and Filters Together

You can use the search bar and filters simultaneously to refine your results.

- **Broad to Narrow**: Start with a broad search term in the search bar, then use filters to narrow down the results.
- **Narrow to Broad**: Alternatively, apply filters first and then use the search bar to find specific documents within that filtered set.
